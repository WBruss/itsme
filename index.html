                    I'm just a tech enthusiast who mostly doesn't know what he is doing.<br/>
                    My vision is to be a seasoned developer and align myself to providing software solutions in
technology reliant sectors such as automobile software engineering and building connectivity. I
want to be an expert level programmer in an array of programming languages; C (embedded
programming), Java, Python, PHP, HTML/CSS, Javascripst. These specialized skills will help me
work my way up to my target as I work for companies that require software developers.

                                    I like how level C is. What you code is what you get. 
                                    I know the basics; variables, conditional statements, loops, pointers and arrays.
